    "    - Used for segmentation for words from sentences, or segmenation of sentences from paragraphs. This process is called tokenization\n",

    "- ### Regular expression functions available in python re package:\n",
    "    - match: finds the first occurence of a pattern in a string\n",
    "    - search: locates the pattern in the string\n",
    "    - findall: find all occurences of pattern in the string\n",
